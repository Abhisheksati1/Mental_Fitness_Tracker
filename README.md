Overview:-
    The Mental Fitness Tracker is a data analysis and machine learning project that aims to track and improve mental well-being. The   project utilizes various mental health datasets, applies regression algorithms, and incorporates user input to predict an individual's   mental fitness score. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, and instructions for running the code.

Features:-
    Data analysis and visualization: Explore and analyze datasets related to mental and substance use disorders.
    Regression modeling: Train and evaluate machine learning models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression.
    User input and prediction: Input mental health parameters to predict and interpret mental fitness scores.
    Personalized guidance: Provide tailored recommendations based on the predicted mental fitness score.
    Performance evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using relevant metrics.
    Customization: The project can be customized by selecting different datasets, algorithms, and user interface modifications.

Usage:-
Prepare the datasets:
    Place the "prevalence-by-mental-and-substance-use-disorder.csv" and "mental-and-substance-use-as-share-of-disease.csv" files in the     appropriate directory.
    Update the file paths in the code to match your directory structure if necessary.

Data preprocessing and analysis:
    Run the code to load and preprocess the datasets, perform exploratory data analysis, and visualize the relationships between variables.

Model training and evaluation:
    Follow the code instructions to train the regression models using the prepared dataset.
    Evaluate the performance of the models using mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R2 score.

User input and prediction:
    Modify the code to incorporate user input for mental health parameters.
    Run the code to predict the mental fitness score based on the user input and interpret the results.

Customization:
    Customize the project by selecting different datasets, algorithms, or modifying the user interface to suit your specific needs.
